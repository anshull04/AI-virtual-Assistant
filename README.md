# AI-virtual-Assistant
Echo is a smart, voice-activated virtual assistant built using JavaScript, the Web Speech API, and REST APIs. It is designed to perform everyday tasks through natural voice interaction — including fetching real-time weather updates, conducting quick web searches, and managing simple to-do lists.
The assistant listens to voice commands, processes input through event-driven scripting, and delivers spoken responses for a seamless hands-free experience. Echo integrates third-party APIs (like OpenWeather, Google Search, etc.) to bring dynamic, real-time functionality into the browser environment.

This project demonstrates the power of browser-native speech recognition and synthesis, making it a lightweight yet effective example of web-based AI interaction. It’s ideal for students and developers interested in voice interfaces, client-side automation, and practical applications of conversational AI.
